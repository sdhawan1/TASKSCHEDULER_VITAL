//schema is the structure for your data
//you can create several schemas within your database for different kinds of data
//collections: contains one kind of data; several per database

var User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
//model gives us an object (User) which has functions that allow us to create, destroy "user" objects

exports.User = User;


var Task = mongoose.model('Task', taskSchema);
exports.Task = Task;

//User.find({username:"sid"});
//mongoose.model gives you the User object, which has the "find" method. 
//User.findOne
//User.findAndRemove
//User.update
//User.save
//etc...
//CRUD: Create, retrieve, update and destroy: mongo usually has these functions built in.
